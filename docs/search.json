    "text": "Objective\nBuilding upon the Submissions Pilot 2 in which a Shiny application created as an R package was successfully transferred to the FDA using the eCTD gateway protocol, the objective of Pilot 4 is to explore novel technologies to bundle the application along with the necessary execution dependencies and streamline the transfer and execution procedures. The specific technologies targeted in this pilot are the following:\n\nContainers: A mechanism to encapsulate a piece of software alongside the environment used for its dependencies and execution. The end user simply needs a container runtime installed on their system to execute a container.\nWebAssembly: A framework inspired by assembly in which applications developed in languages such as JavaScript, Python, and now R can be compiled into a self-contained native bundle that can be executed directly in a userâ€™s modern web browser, without requiring additional software on their host system."
